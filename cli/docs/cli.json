For example, webhook receiver liveness probes include the HTTP status code returned by the receiver endpoint.\n\nNote that the response status is `200 OK` as long as a probe request was able to be sent to the receiver endpoint. If an HTTP-based receiver, such as a webhook, responds to the another status code, including an error, this will be indicated by the response body, *not* the status of the response.\n\nThe `resend` query parameter can be used to request re-delivery of failed events if the liveness probe succeeds. If it is set to true and the liveness probe succeeds, any alerts for which delivery to this receiver has failed will be queued for re-delivery.",
