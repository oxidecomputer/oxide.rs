# Oxide SDK and CLI

This repo contains two published crates: the Oxide Rust SDK and the Oxide CLI.
The SDK and CLI are derived from the Oxide API OpenAPI spec and provide
interfaces for interacting with the Oxide Rack.

## Generation

Both the SDK and CLI rely on
https://github.com/oxidecomputer/progenitor[`progenitor`] for code generation
from the OpenAPI description of the Oxide API. Typically `progenitor` is used
via a macro or `build.rs`, here we use an
https://github.com/matklad/cargo-xtask['xtask`]. Not only is the source OpenAPI
document checked in, we also check-in the generated code 1. so that changes in
generated output (in addition to input) may be easily tracked and 2. so that
navigating from rustdoc to source shows the full code rather than, say, an
opaque macro invocation (that yields literally tens of thousands of lines of
code).

The Oxide OpenAPI description is in `oxide.json`. To re-generate the CLI and
SDK from an updated API document, run `cargo xtask generate`. CI ensures that
the API description and generated code are in sync.

NOTE: generation requires that a nightly version of `rustfmt` is installed.

## Hand-written code

While both the SDK and CLI are *mostly* generated, both include some hand-
written code as well.

The SDK includes hand-written code to simplify the use of some aspects of the
API and to support the CLI. For example, it includes a `clap`-related `impl`
block so that the `ByteCount` type can be specified with a binary suffix (e.g.
`64gb`).

The CLI includes hand-written code for some of the blocking and tackling. It
also has hand-written code to add additional subcommands (e.g. `auth`) and to
augment commands that cannot be fully or optimally generated.
